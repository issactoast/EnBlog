## Make your own function

We know `R` can do some calculation. I am always confused when I use Fahrenheit, "ºF", instead of using Celsius "ºC". I searched the conversion formula on the internet.

    (°F − 32) × 5/9 = °C

Based on the formula, 89 Fahrenheit is equal to 31.7 Celsius as follows;

```{r}
(89 - 32) * 5/9
```

Can you convert the following Fahrenheits in Celcius?

```{r eval=FALSE}
67, 45, 92, 83, 70
```

We can run the following five codes;

```{r}
(67 - 32) * 5/9
(45 - 32) * 5/9
(92 - 32) * 5/9
(83 - 32) * 5/9
(70 - 32) * 5/9
```

or, run the following compact codes;

```{r}
myF <- c(67, 45, 92, 83, 70)
(myF - 32) * 5/9
```

Here is a problem; I dont want to memorise this annoying formula every time. I want a nice function like name like `convFtoC` and use that function as follows;

```{r eval=FALSE}
convFtoC(67)
```

So, let us make a function which gives us the numver in Celcius when we feed Fahrenheits to the function.

```{r}
convFtoC <- function(numF){
    result <- (numF - 32) * 5/9
    result
}
```

Above, we define a function named `convFtoC` whose input is Fahrenheits, `numF`, and its output is the corresponding number in Celcius.

```{r}
convFtoC(89)
```

which has the same result as the following result.

```{r}
(89 - 32) * 5/9
```


### Mode function(This is an advanced part you can skip for now)

Mode is the value which is the most frequently appreared in a data set. To find a mode of the data, we need to calculate the frequency of the data. We already learned a `table` function when we draw a pie chart.

```{r}
x <- c(1, 3, 9, 7, 1, 2, 2, 5, 3, 3, 3)
result <- table(x)
result
```

It says `3` is the most frequently appears in the data vector; 4 times appears.


 
```{r}
sort(unique(x))

Mode <- function(x) {
  ux <- unique(x)
  ux[which.max(tabulate(match(x, ux)))]
}
Mode(x)
```

## Making categorical variables

### Comparing numbers

In `R`, there are some useful operators. For example, by using `==`, we can ask `R` to determine whether the two values are same.

```{r}
1 == 2
```

We can compare the values, too.

```{r}
1 < 2
3 > 2
5 <= 6
c(1, 2, 3) < 2
```

The last code that I wrote will be very useful when we want to manipulate the data. Here is a toy example.

```{r}
a <- c(1:10)
a
```

We have learned that we can access the subset of the object using `[]` command as follows;

```{r}
a[1:5] <- c(1, 5, 3, 2, 4)
a
```

What if I want to access the elements in `a` variable which satisfies some criteria? For example, what if I want to **filter** the elements which are less than 4?

```{r}
a[a < 4]
```

How this happen? Let's see what is the result of `a < 4`.

```{r}
a < 4
```

Thus, what we did is to use this TRUE and FALSE vector for picking the elements in `a`. If you understand the above code, we can try these things;

```{r}
a
b <- rep(0, 10) # repeat 0s 10 times
b[a < 4]  <- "low"
b[a >= 4] <- "high"
b
```

After obtaining the categorical vector `b`, we can draw a box plot using `R` code from week 2 material as follow;

```{r}
mytable <- table(b)
pie(mytable, 
    labels = names(mytable),
    main="Pie Chart of categorical variable")
```
