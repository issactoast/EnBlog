## Data loading again

```{r echo=TRUE}
mydata <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/issactoast/EnBlog/master/static/files/stat2010/examscore.csv", header = TRUE)
head(mydata)
```

If you success to load R file, you can see the above results.

### Mode

Mode is the value which is the most frequently appreared in a data set. To find a mode of the data, we need to calculate the frequency of the data. We already learned a `table` function when we draw a pie chart.

```{r}
x <- c(1, 3, 9, 7, 1, 2, 2, 5, 3, 3, 3)
result <- table(x)
result
```

It says `3` is the most frequently appears in the data vector; 4 times appears.


 
```{r}
sort(unique(mydata$midterm1))

Mode <- function(x) {
  ux <- unique(x)
  ux[which.max(tabulate(match(x, ux)))]
}
Mode(mydata$midterm1)
```
