## Problem 1

A large warehouse is flled with light bulbs. An electronics engineer wants to estimate the mean lifespan of these bulbs. To this end, 18 of the bulbs were randomly selected and the lifespan was measures; the mean lifespan of the 18 bulbs was 2550 hours.

- What is the population?
- What is the sample?
- What is the parameter?
- What is the sample statistics?

## Problem 2

In a survey of 400 randomly selected UI students, 30% of students said they like a chocolate ice cream. The margin of error is 3% points. What is the confidence interval for the proportion of the people who like a chocolate ice cream?

## Problem 3 - Sampling Methods

- Simple Random Sampling (SRS) : Every sample has an equal chance of being selected
- Systematic Sampling: "every *k*-th"..
- Convenience Sampling: literally convenient to ask, ex. friends.
- Cluster Sampling: pick group and choose all units of the chosen groups.
- Stratified Sampling: Divide the population into subgroups, choose a sample from each group.

## Problem 4

A researcher is interested in finding out whether non-sleeping causes sevier damages to human brain. Here is what he plans to do:

1. Step 1: Randomly select 100 human nationwide whose brains are currently working well
1. Step 2: Randomly assign 50 of the 100 people to the non-sleeping group and the other 50 to the sleeping group;
1. Step 3: Those in the non-sleeping group are not allow to sleep for 5 days whereas those in the other group maintain their normal life cycles
1. Step 4: Compare the brain functionality of these 2 groups after a week.

- What is the treatment group and the control group?
- What are the response variable(s) and explanatory variable(s)?
- Do you think this is a good experimental design? Why?
