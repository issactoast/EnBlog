As an employee, I am trying to construct my own portfolio thesedays. By sharing my research materials, I hope that my article makes you either become interested in me or in the driving telematics topic.

All the code used in here written by me. I wrote them for doing my Ph.D. research. Thus, they are not efficient code and has a lot of room for improvements and also it might has some typo or error. If you found any typo or error in my code, feel free to leave a comment or contact me. I would be really happy and appreciate your feedback.

## GPS data visualization

GPS is probably the most popular data format, which has information about the position of the device. At the beginning of my research, I tried to use to record my commute route. To record the telematics data, I attched my phone to my vehicle, and recorded the position of my vehicle per second using smartphone sensor app.

Here is the sample sensor data that contains the information of my commute route data.

```{r }
