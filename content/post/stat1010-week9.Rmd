## Normal distribution

From the basic statistics course, we are already familiar with a bell-shape distribution called Normal distribution.

Here are some characteristics of all Normal curves;

    - Symmetric, Unimodal
    - It can be specified by its mean and standard deviation.
    - Mean is related to center of the distribution.
    - Sd controls the spread of the distribution.
    - All Normal distribution obey the 68-95-99.7 rule.

Our textbook use the following notation for refering a specific normal distribution;

$$
\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma)
$$
where $\mu$ represents the mean and $\sigma$ represents the standard deviation.

Let us look at the impact of the mean and standard deviation on the shape of Normal distribtuions.

```{r echo=FALSE}
x <- seq(-5, 5, by= 0.1)
plot(x, dnorm(x), type = "l",
     xlim = c(-5, 5),
     xlab = "", ylab = "",
     main = "Impact of the mean on Normal distribution",
     sub = "black: Normal(0, 1), red: Normal (2, 1)", axes = F)
abline(h=0)
points(x, dnorm(x, 2, sd = 1), type = "l", col = 2)
axis(1, at = seq(-4, 4, by = 2), las = 1)
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
x <- seq(-5, 5, by= 0.1)
plot(x, dnorm(x), type = "l",
     xlim = c(-5, 5),
     xlab = "", ylab = "",
     main = "Impact of the std on Normal distribution",
     sub = "black: Normal(0, 1), red: Normal (0, 2)", axes = F)
abline(h=0)
points(x, dnorm(x, 0, sd = 2), type = "l", col = 2)
axis(1, at = seq(-4, 4, by = 2), las = 1)
```

## The 68-95-99.7 rule

The rule is as follows;

    - Approx. 68% of the obs. fall within one std. range of the mean.
    - Approx. 95% of the obs. fall within two std. range of the mean.
    - Approx. 99.7% of the obs. fall within three std. range of the mean.

### Example

```{r echo=FALSE}
x <- seq(5, 20, by= 0.1)
plot(x, dnorm(x, 10, 2), type = "l",
     xlim = c(5, 15),
     xlab = "", ylab = "",
     main = "Distribution of Homework score",
     sub = "Normal(10, 2)",
     axes = F)
abline(h=0)
axis(1, at = seq(5, 15, by = 2), las = 1)
```

Professor upload the distribution of Homework score in ICON as above and the class consists of 100 students.

- Q1. You checked your score out and found that your score was 12. How many people got the homework score which is below yours approximately?

<details>
<summary>
Answer
</summary>

12 is the score which is one standard deviation above from the mean.

84% = 50% + 34%

about 84 students.
</details>

- Q2. How many people got the homework scores which are between 10 and 14?

<details>
<summary>
Answer
</summary>

47.5% = 95% / 2

Thus, about 48 students obtained the score between 10 and 14.
</details>


- Q3. How many people got the homework scores which are between 8 and 14?

<details>
<summary>
Answer
</summary>

81.5% = 47.5% + 34%

About 82 students.
</details>


- Q4. Do you think the following statement is right?
    
        IQR of the homework score is larger than 4.

<details>
<summary>
Answer
</summary>

No. IQR is shorter than 1 standard deviation range from the mean. Since IQR captures the middle 50%, 1 std range will capture about middle 68%.
