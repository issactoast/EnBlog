Let us assume that we have following data set;

    50, 80, 60, 90, 70

## Mean

The mean is the sum of all values in a data set divided by the number of values in the data set.

$$
mean = \frac{50 + 80 + 60 + 90 + 70}{5} = 70
$$

Q. What is the mean of these numbers?

    10, 11, 21, 13, 20, 16

$$
mean = \frac{10+11+21+13+20+16}{6} = 15.17
$$

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
x <- c(10, 11, 21, 13, 20, 16)
round(mean(x), 2)

```

## Median

The "middle" of a **sorted** list of numbers in your data set. 

Step 1. Sort your data set.

    50, 60, 70, 80, 90

Step 2. Find the middle number of the sorted sequence.

    `70` is the median of the data set.
    
### What if we have even number of data set such as the following data set?

    10, 11, 21, 13, 20, 16

Q. What is the median of these numbers?

Step 1. Sort the number

```{r echo=FALSE}
x <- c(10, 11, 21, 13, 20, 16)
sort(x)

```

Step 2. Find the middle number.

Since we have even number of data, our median should be between 13 and 16.

$$
median = \frac{13 + 16}{2} = 14.5
$$

## Weighted Mean

To find a weighted mean you multiply each data value by its “weight,”add those all up, and divide by the sum of the weights.

Let's consider we have students who are taking stat. course; Issac and Dakota.

- Issac got 80 points for the homework score out of 100 and 60 points for the exam score out of 100.

- Dakota got 60 points for the homework score out of 100 and 80 points for the exam score out of 100.

Issac told Dakota,

    "Hey, I think we should get the same grade since we have same average(mean) score."

And he shows the following equation;

$$
\frac{80 + 60}{2} = \frac{60 + 80}{2}
$$

Dakota thinks that is not fair since he think that the **exam score is more important than the homework score**.

How can he suggest more reasonable measure for the students' score? He found that Issac use an eqaution which use the same weights for homework and exam score; 50 \% for each category.

$$
\begin{align}
Dakota's \ score & = \frac{60 + 80}{2} \\
&= \frac{1}{2}\times 60 + \frac{1}{2}\times 80 \\
& = 0.5 \times 60 + 0.5 \times 80 \\
& = 50\% \ (hw) \times 60 + 50\% \ (exam)\times 80 \\
& = 70
\end{align}
$$

Dakota suggests the weighted average for the student's final score which gives more weights to the exam score than the homework score;

    30% for Homework
    70% for Exam

After using this weighted average, Dakota's final score is larger than Issac's score as follows;

$$
\begin{align}
Dakota's \ score & = 30\% \times 60 + 70\% \times 80 \\
& = 0.3 \times 60 + 0.7 \times 80 \\
& = 74 \\
Issac's \ score & = 30\% \times 80 + 70\% \times 60 \\
& = 0.3 \times 80 + 0.7 \times 60 \\
& = 66
\end{align}
$$

Q. What is the weighted mean of these numbers?

    math: 80, english: 70, history: 50,
    weights: math - 30%, english - 20%, history - 50%

$$
80 \times 0.3 + 70 \times 0.2 + 50 \times 0.5 $$

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
80 * 0.3 + 70 * 0.2 + 50 * 0.5
```
