# Basic R code and Data loading


## Variable in R


```{r}
a <- 4
a
```

```{r}
b <- 2
b
```

```{r}
b <- 3
b
```

```{r}
a+b
```

# Arithmetic operation
a + b
a - b
a / b
a * b
a^2
sqrt(b) # b^0.5

a %% b  # mod
a %/% b # value

a <- 2
a <- c(1, 2, 3)
b <- c(4, 5, 6)

# sometimes vector can be longer than you think
a <- c(1:10)

# define vector with seq.
seq(0, 1, by = 0.01)
seq(0, 1, length.out = 4)


# recycling 
a <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
a + 1          # a + c(1, 1, 1, 1)
a + c(1, 2)    # a + c(1, 2, 1, 2)
a + c(1, 2, 3) # a + c(1, 2, 3, 1) 


a <- seq(2, 100, by = 2) # even numbers
b <- seq(1, 100, by = 2) # odd numbers

a <- seq(1, 100, by = 2)
b <- a + 1
