# Basic R code and Data loading

Today we will learn about the basic `R` codes and how to load data file to `R`.

## R as a calculator.


```{r eval=FALSE}
2 + 1
3 - 2
2 * 3
4 / 2
4^2
sqrt(4) # 4^0.5
9 %% 4  # mod
9 %/% 4 # value
```


## Variable in R


```{r eval=FALSE}
a <- 4
a
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
b <- 2
b
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
b <- 3
b
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
a+b
```

Variable contains not only a number but also many things.

```{r eval=FALSE}
a <- c(1, 2, 3)
b <- c(4, 5, 6)
a
b
```

Sometimes vector can be longer than you think

```{r}
a <- c(1:10)
a
```

# define vector with seq.
seq(0, 1, by = 0.01)
seq(0, 1, length.out = 4)


# recycling 
a <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
a + 1          # a + c(1, 1, 1, 1)
a + c(1, 2)    # a + c(1, 2, 1, 2)
a + c(1, 2, 3) # a + c(1, 2, 3, 1) 


a <- seq(2, 100, by = 2) # even numbers
b <- seq(1, 100, by = 2) # odd numbers

a <- seq(1, 100, by = 2)
b <- a + 1
