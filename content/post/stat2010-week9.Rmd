## Summary

Here is the code that we used for the regression summary discussion.

```{r echo=TRUE}
# make dataset
mydata <- data.frame(
  kneeh  = c(57.7, 47.4,43.5,44.8,55.2,54.6),
  height = c(192.1,153.3,146.4,162.7,169.1,177.8)
)

# regression
model1 <- lm(height ~ kneeh, mydata)

# regression objects
model1$coefficients
model1$residuals # 2
model1$df.residual
model1$fitted.values # 1
```

## Add regression line

Your code become compact by using 'with' command as follows;

```{r}
# For plotting
# the following two lines of code are same;
# plot(mydata$kneeh, mydata$height)
# with(mydata, plot(kneeh, height)) 

# Add reg. line
# the following three lines are the same meaning
# abline(model1$coefficients[1], model1$coefficients[2])
# with(model1, abline(coefficients[1], coefficients[2]))
# with(model1, abline(coefficients))
```

Thus, final code could be as follows;

```{r}
# plot & add reg. line
with(mydata, plot(kneeh, height))
with(model1, abline(coefficients))
```

## Prediction for the new data

We need to use dataframe to use `prediction` function, otherwise we can use the formula.

```{r}
# prediction
new_x <- data.frame(kneeh = c(50, 52, 47.7, 55))
predict(model1, newdata = new_x)
```
