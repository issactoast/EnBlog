<p>As an employee, I am trying to construct my own portfolio thesedays. By sharing my research materials, I hope that my article makes you either become interested in me or in the driving telematics topic.</p>
<p>All the code used in here written by me. I wrote them for doing my Ph.D.Â research. Thus, they are not efficient code and has a lot of room for improvements and also it might has some typo or error. If you found any typo or error in my code, feel free to leave a comment or contact me. I would be really happy and appreciate your feedback.</p>

<h2>GPS data visualization</h2>
<p>GPS is probably the most popular data format, which has information about the position of the device. At the beginning of my research, I tried to use to record my commute route. To record the telematics data, I attched my phone to my vehicle, and recorded the position of my vehicle per second using smartphone sensor app.</p>
<p>Here is the sample sensor data that contains the information of my commute route data.</p>
