Let us assume that we have following data set;

```{r echo=FALSE}
mydata <- c(67, 61, 68, 80, 63, 75, 62, 
            66, 56, 72, 53, 79, 76, 54, 70)
```

    67, 61, 68, 80, 63, 75, 62, 66, 56, 72, 53, 79, 76, 54, 70

## Histogram

If I draw a histogram with the above data using 5 bins, it looks like the following plot.

```{r echo=FALSE}
hist(mydata, breaks = c(50, 56, 62, 68, 74, 80),
     axes = F)
axis(1, at = seq(50, 80, by = 6), las = 1)
axis(2, at = seq(0, 4, by = 1), las = 2)
```


Q. Can you draw the histogram with 3 bins? What does it look like?

```{r echo=FALSE}
hist(mydata, breaks = c(50, 60, 70, 80))
```

## Stem-and-Leaf plot

A stemp plot consists of two parts; 

    - Stem: usually takes care about ten's 
    - Leaves: takes care about one's
    
The stemplot for the above data look like this.

```{r echo=FALSE}
stem(mydata)
```

Q. What is the minimun number in the data set?

Answer
</summary>
The minimum of our data set is 53.

Q. Practice to draw a stemplot using following numbers.

    60 61 57 62 61 65 52 68 70 70 61 53 70 67 66

```{r echo=FALSE}
mydata <- c(60, 61, 57, 62, 61, 65, 52,
            68, 70, 70, 61, 53, 70 ,67, 66)
```

If you understand the logic of stemplot, you will get this result;

```{r echo=FALSE}
stem(mydata, scale = 0.5)
```
