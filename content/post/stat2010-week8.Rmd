## Scatter plot again

```{r echo=TRUE}
# load data
mydata <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/issactoast/EnBlog/master/static/files/stat2010/examscore.csv", header = TRUE)

# clean data; choose 1~5 columns as data set
mydata <- mydata[,1:5]

# check the result
head(mydata)
```

Let us draw the scatter plots for the midterm1 vs. midterm2.

```{r}
plot(mydata$midterm1, mydata$midterm2)
```

### Scatter plot with categorical variable

We can add more information in the plot using color and shape. `pch` option determines the shape of the data points.

```{r}
plot(mydata$midterm1, mydata$midterm2,
     pch = c(16, 17, 18)[mydata$class],
     col = c("red", "green","blue")[mydata$class],
     xlab = "midterm 1", ylab = "midterm 2")
```

Here are the list of the shapes which corresponds to the number in `pch` option.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggpubr::show_point_shapes()
```


## Correlation

By looking at the above plots, we can see the relationship between the variables. The correlation coefficient, especially, can be used for measuring the linear relationship between the variables. Our textbook has the following correlation formula;

$$
r=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(\frac{x_{i}-\overline{x}}{s_{x}}\right)\left(\frac{y_{i}-\overline{y}}{s_{y}}\right)
$$

For example, the correlation coefficient for the two pair of midterm scores is as follows;

```{r}
cor(mydata$midterm1, mydata$midterm2)
```

Here are some facts that you need to know.

1. The correlation $r$ has a value between -1 and 1. 0 correlation indicates a very weak linear relationship.
1. Correlation makes no distinction between explanatory and responds variables. i.e. the correlation between `midterm1` and `midterm2` is equal to the one between `midterm2` and `midterm1`.
1. It does not depends on the scale. It means multiplication, division, summation, or substraction do not affect to the correlation.
1. Positive value of $r$ means positive association, and Negative value for negative association.

### Correlation coefficient by hand

Let's calculate the correlation coefficient of the following two varible $x$ and $y$. (std. for x and y are 1.58)

    x: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    y: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

```{r echo=FALSE}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y <- c(6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
plot(x, y)
```

How about this?

    x: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    y: 6, 10, 8, 7, 9

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y <- c(6, 10, 8, 7, 9)
cor(x, y)
plot(x, y)
```


</details>


### Correlation coefficient using `R` code

Let us check how the `cor()` works above. Our target is to calculate the correlation between `midterm1` and `midterm2`.

```{r}
m1 <- mean(mydata$midterm1)
m2 <- mean(mydata$midterm2)
s1 <- sd(mydata$midterm1)
s2 <- sd(mydata$midterm2)
z_x <- (mydata$midterm1 - m1)/s1
z_y <- (mydata$midterm2 - m2)/s2
sum(z_x * z_y) / 29
```

## Regression

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
head(mydata)
# x <- as.integer(rnorm(30, 40, 15))
# y_m <- 1 * x[1:15] + 10 + rnorm(15, 0, 15)
# y_w <- 1.3 * x[16:30] + rnorm(15, 0, 15)
# y <- as.integer(c(y_m, y_w))
# plot(x, y)
# 
# mydata2 <- data.frame(midterm = x, final = y, gender = rep(c("M", "F"), each = 15))
# mydata2 <- mydata2[sample(c(1:30), 30, replace = FALSE),]
# mydata2$student_id <- 1:30
# mydata2 <- dplyr::select(mydata2, student_id, gender, midterm, final)
# write.csv(mydata2,'examscore2.csv')
```

### Load a new data

```{r}
# load data
mydata2 <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/issactoast/EnBlog/master/static/files/stat2010/examscore2.csv", header = TRUE)

# check the result
head(mydata2)
```

Draw a scatter plot again.

```{r}
plot(mydata2$midterm, mydata2$final)

```

### Find a regression line

```{r}
model1 <- lm(final ~ midterm, data = mydata2)

summary(model1)
```

Using the information above, we can draw a regression line in the plot;

```{r}
# draw regression line
plot(mydata2$midterm, mydata2$final)
abline(13.8866, 0.8967, col = "red")
```

What if we want to predict a final score of the student who got 45 for the midterm?

```{r}
# predition for new student
# student's midterm : 45
y_hat = 13.8866 + 0.8967 * 45

# draw a point in the plot
plot(mydata2$midterm, mydata2$final)
abline(13.8866, 0.8967, col = "red")
points(45, y_hat, col = "blue", cex = 2, pch = 16)
```

Note that `cex` option determines the size of dot and `pch` option is related to the shape.

Let us confirm the coefficients calculation process again using basic `R` code.

```{r}
# corr.
r <- cor(mydata2$midterm, mydata2$final)

# mean
x_bar <- mean(mydata2$midterm)
y_bar <- mean(mydata2$final)

# std.
s_x <- sd(mydata2$midterm)
s_y <- sd(mydata2$final)


# coefficients
b <- r * s_y / s_x        #slope
a <- y_bar - (b * x_bar)  # intercept
a; b
```

### $r^2$

$r^2$ is litterally the square of the correlation. This can be interpreted as the fraction of the variation in the values of $y$ that is explained by the regression line.

```{r}
# r^2 
r^2
```

It means 45% of the variation of the data can be explained by the regression line.

### Regression for the two groups

We knows that the data has one more categorical variable.

```{r}
plot(mydata2$midterm, mydata2$final,
     pch = c(16, 17)[as.factor(mydata2$gender)],
     col = c("red", "blue")[as.factor(mydata2$gender)],
     xlab = "midterm", ylab = "final")
```

It seems like Male students (blue dots) and the Female students (red dots) has different characteristics. Let's find regression line for each group!

```{r}
data_male <- mydata2[mydata2$gender == "M", ]
data_female <- mydata2[mydata2$gender == "F", ]

# regression for each group
model2 <- lm(final~midterm, data_male)
model3 <- lm(final~midterm, data_female)

# coeff.
print("male"); model2$coefficients # male
print("female"); model3$coefficients # female
```

Let's look at the plot with the regression lines that we just found.

```{r}
plot(mydata2$midterm, mydata2$final,
     pch = c(16, 17)[as.factor(mydata2$gender)],
     col = c("red", "blue")[as.factor(mydata2$gender)],
     xlab = "midterm", ylab = "final")
abline(7.1622492, 0.9737074, col = "blue")
abline(30.509843, 0.597766, col = "red")
```

## Prediction

Using the regression line above, how do we predict the final score for the female student whose midterm score is 45?

```{r}

```
