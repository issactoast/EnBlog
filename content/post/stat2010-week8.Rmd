## Scatter plot again

```{r echo=TRUE}
# load data
mydata <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/issactoast/EnBlog/master/static/files/stat2010/examscore.csv", header = TRUE)

# clean data; choose 1~5 columns as data set
mydata <- mydata[,1:5]

# check the result
head(mydata)
```

Let us draw the scatter plots for the midterm1 vs. final and midterm1 vs. midterm2.

```{r}
plot(mydata$midterm1, mydata$final, asp=1)
```

```{r}
plot(mydata$midterm1, mydata$midterm2, asp=1,
     xlim = c(60, 95), ylim = c(45, 80))

```

## Correlation

By looking at the above plots, we can see the relationship between the variables. The correlation coefficient, especially, can be used for measuring the linear relationship between the variables. For example, the correlation coefficient for the two pair of variables in the above is as follows;

```{r}
cor(mydata$midterm1, mydata$final)
cor(mydata$midterm1, mydata$midterm2)
```

Based on the correlation, midterm1 and midterm2 are linearly associated each other, while the midterm1 and final are almost independant each other.

```{r}
x <- seq(1000, 1400, by = 10)
y <- dnorm(x, mean = 1200, sd = 50)
plot(x, y, type = "l",
     main = "Distribution of SAT scores",
     xlab = "SAT score",
     ylab = "density")
abline(v = 1300)
```
