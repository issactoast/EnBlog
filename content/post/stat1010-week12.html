<h3>Problem 1. Sample spaces</h3>
<p>For each of the following, list the possible outcomes and tell whether you think the events are equally likely</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Roll one die, recore the numbers that you have.</li>
<li>Roll two dice, recore the sum of the numbers.</li>
<li>Toss four coins, recore the number of tails.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Problem 2. Dice</h3>
<p>Let us assume that we have thrown a fair die whose color is black. A fair dice means that it has an equal probability of having each number.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Find the chance that the die shows three spot.</li>
<li>Find the chance that the number on the die is less than two.</li>
<li>Find the chance that the number on the die is larger than two.</li>
</ol>
<p>My your friend gave you a white die to you. Now you have thrown a pair of dice.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Find the chance that both dice show three spot.</li>
<li>Find the chance that the numbers on the dice are the same.</li>
<li>Find the chance that the number on the black die is larger than the one on the white die.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Problem 3. Eletronics</h3>
<p>Suppose that 38% of families living in a certain country own a computer and 52% own an HDTV. The Addition Rule might suggest, then, that 90% of families own either a computer or an HDTV. What’s wrong with that reasoning?</p>
<p>It turns out that there are 21% of families own an HDTV and a computer.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Draw the Venn diagram for this situation.</li>
<li>What’s the probability that a randomly selected family has a HDTV but no computer?</li>
<li>What’s the probability that a randomly selected family has a HDTV, or a computer?</li>
<li>What’s the probability that a randomly selected family has a HDTV, or a computer, but not both?</li>
<li>What’s the probability that a randomly selected family has neither a HDTV nor a computer?</li>
</ol>
