# Data loading again

```{r echo=TRUE}
mydata <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/issactoast/EnBlog/master/static/files/stat2010/examscore.csv", header = TRUE)
head(mydata)
```

If you success to load R file, you can see the above results.

# Data visualization 2

## Box plot

```{r}
boxplot(mydata$midterm1,
        main="Box plot for midterm 1",
        xlab="Score",
        ylab="Exam name",
        horizontal = TRUE)
```

```{r}
mydata$midterm1[1] <- 50
boxplot(mydata$midterm1, mydata$midterm2,
        main="Box plot for midterms",
        names = c("Midterm 1", "Midterm 2"),
        xlab="Score",
        ylab="Exam name",
        horizontal = TRUE)
```


## Detect outlier

## Data coding

### Dummy variable
 
### Missing value



You can use `$` to indicate the colum that you want to access.

```{r}
mydata$midterm1
```

The bracket `[]` works too.

```{r}
mydata[,3]
mydata[1,] # the data related to the first student in the list
```

## Draw a pie chart using `table` function

To draw a pie chart, we need to count how many of data points we have for each category.

```{r}
mytable <- table(mydata$class)
mytable
names(mytable)
```

We can use the name of table as the categories itself in pie chart. 

```{r}
pie(mytable, 
    labels = names(mytable),
    main="Pie Chart of the class variable")
```

Or, we can define our own name set as follows;

```{r}
pie(mytable, 
    labels = c("Class 1", "Class 2", "Class 3"),
    main="Pie Chart of the class variable")
```


## Stem and leaf plot

There is a function called `stem` for drawing a stem and leaf plot.

```{r}
stem(mydata$midterm2)
```

This stem and leaf plot has 5 as a unit lenght. Let's make it as 10 for the unit step. Using scale option, 

```{r}
stem(mydata$midterm2, scale = 0.5)
```

## Histogram

```{r}
hist(mydata$midterm2)
```

We can make a custom breaks as follows;

```{r}
hist(mydata$midterm2, breaks= c(4:8)*10) # or
hist(mydata$midterm2, breaks= c(40, 50, 60, 70, 80))
```

```{r}
hist(mydata$midterm2, breaks= c(4:8)*10,
     xlab = "Midterm 2 score",
     main = "Histogram of midterm 2 scores")
```

Using `mean` and `median`, you can describe the characteristics of the distribution as follows;

```{r}
mean(mydata$midterm2)
median(mydata$midterm2)
```


## Scatter plot

```{r}
plot(mydata$midterm1, mydata$midterm2)
```

`lm` function name stands for 'linear model', which is a statistical concept including the linear regression. By using `lm` function, we can obtain a lot of information about the regression analysis as follows;

```{r}
x <- mydata$midterm1
y <- mydata$midterm2
result <- lm(y~x)
result
```


```{r}
plot(x, y)
points(x, result$fitted.values,
       type = "l", col = "red")
```

When you draw a plot, it is important to set the same scale for x and y variables. `xlim` and `ylim` options in `plot` function allow us to set the range for each axis. 
 
```{r}
plot(x, y,
     xlim = c(60, 100), ylim = c(40, 80),
     xlab = "Midterm 1 score", 
     ylab = "Midterm 2 score",
     main = "Plot of Midterm scores")
points(x, result$fitted.values,
       type = "l", col = "red")
```
