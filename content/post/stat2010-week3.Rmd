## Data loading again

```{r echo=TRUE}
mydata <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/issactoast/EnBlog/master/static/files/stat2010/examscore.csv", header = TRUE)
head(mydata)
```

If you success to load R file, you can see the above results.

## Data visualization 2

### Box plot

```{r}
boxplot(mydata$midterm1,
        main="Box plot for midterm 1",
        xlab="Score",
        ylab="Exam name",
        horizontal = TRUE)
```

Let us make an outlier in our data set.

```{r}
mydata$midterm1[1] <- 60 # what does this mean?

boxplot(mydata$midterm1,
        main="Box plot for midterm 1",
        xlab="Score",
        ylab="Exam name",
        horizontal = TRUE)
```

## Estimation of central part of data

### mean

```{r}
x <- 6:10
mean(x)
```

Q. What is the mean score for midterm 1 score?

```{r}
mean(mydata$midterm1)
```

### median

```{r}
x <- 6:10
y <- 5:10
median(x)
median(y)
```

Q. What is the median of midterm 1 score?

```{r}
median(mydata$midterm1)
```

Q. Which one is bigger? What would you say about the shape of the midterm 1 score's distribution?

### Mode

## Estimation of spread of data

### Quantiles

`R` has a function named `quantile` to calculate five more popular statistics;

```{r}
quantile(mydata$midterm1)
```

We can see the value corresponds to `0%` is the minimum of the data. In the same manner, the value with `100%` is the maximum of the data.

```{r}
# The first quartile (Q1)
quantile(mydata$midterm1)[2]

# The third quartile (Q3)
quantile(mydata$midterm1)[4]
```
