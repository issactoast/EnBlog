## Problem 1 (Data types)

Definitions:

1. **Qualitative data**: values that can be placed into nonnumerical categories.

    - *Nominal* level of measurement - No ranking!
    
    - *Ordianl* level of measurement - It has ranking system!

2. **Quantitative data**: values representing counts or measurments

    - *Countinuous* data takes any value in a given interval.
    
    - *Discrete* data can take on only particular, distinct values and not other values in between.

Classify each of the following data as qualitative or quantitative.

- Ice cream brands in Hyvee.
- Heights of U of Iowa students
- Your final grade of this course
- Favarite ice cream flavors of students in this class

## Problem 2 (Size of the errors)

1. **Absolute error**: how far a claimed or measured value lies from the true value.

    Absolute error = measured value - true value
    
2. **Relative error**: comparing the size of the absolute error to the true value.

    Relative error = abs. error / true value * 100
    
    
Could you tell me the example about these two error? Here is mine;

    I ordered a food which cost $12 in a restaurant, but server charged my $10 by mistake;
    
    - Absolute error? and Relative error?
    

## Accuracy vs. Precision

Accuracy: how closely a measurement approximates a true value.

Precision: the amount of detail in a measurement.
