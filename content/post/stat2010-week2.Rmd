# Data loading again

```{r echo=TRUE}
mydata <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/issactoast/EnBlog/master/static/files/stat2010/examscore.csv", header = TRUE)
head(mydata)
```

If you success to load R file, you can see the above results.

# Data visualization

## Access to the colums of your data

You can use `$` to indicate the colum that you want to access.

```{r eval = FALSE}
mydata$midterm1
```

The bracket `[]` works too.

```{r eval=FALSE}
mydata[,3]
mydata[1,] # the data related to the first student in the list
```

## Draw a pie chart using `table` function

To draw a pie chart, we need to count how many of data points we have for each category.

```{r}
mytable <- table(mydata$class)
mytable
names(mytable)
```

We can use the name of table as the categories itself in pie chart. 

```{r}
pie(mytable, 
    labels = names(mytable),
    main="Pie Chart of the class variable")
```

Or, we can define our own name set as follows;

```{r}
pie(mytable, 
    labels = c("Class 1", "Class 2", "Class 3"),
    main="Pie Chart of the class variable")
```


## Stem and leaf plot

There is a function called `stem` for drawing a stem and leaf plot.

```{r}
stem(mydata$midterm2)
```

This stem and leaf plot has 5 as a unit lenght. Let's make it as 10 for the unit step. Using scale option, 

```{r}
stem(mydata$midterm2, scale = 0.5)
```

## Histogram

```{r}
hist(mydata$midterm2)
```

We can make a custom breaks as follows;

```{r}
hist(mydata$midterm2, breaks= c(4:8)*10) # or
hist(mydata$midterm2, breaks= c(40, 50, 60, 70, 80))
```
