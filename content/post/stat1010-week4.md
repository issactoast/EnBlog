## "More than" vs. "Of"

Definitions:

1. Using "of"

    In a class, there are 30 students. By the policy of the university, 10% `of` the class will get 'A' grades. How many people would get 'A' at the end of the semester?

2. Using "more than"

    Issac runs an ice cream store and today he got 100 customers. He wants to forecast the number of tomorrow's customers using statistical method. After the study, he predicts that the number of the customers will be 50% more than today's customer. How many people would come tomorrow based on his analysis?

## Percentages of Percentages

In a class, 20% of the students catch a cold. After 1 week later, we found that only 5% of students in the class still have a cold. Using percentage of people with a cold last week as the reference value, compare the percentage of people with a cold before and after in absolute and relative terms.
