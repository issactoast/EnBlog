<div id="normal-distribution" class="section level2">
<h2>Normal distribution</h2>
<p>From the basic statistics course, we are already familiar with a bell-shape distribution called Normal distribution.</p>
<p>Here are some characteristics of all Normal curves;</p>
<pre><code>- Symmetric, Unimodal
- It can be specified by its mean and standard deviation.
- Mean is related to center of the distribution.
- Sd controls the spread of the distribution.
- All Normal distribution obey the 68-95-99.7 rule.</code></pre>
<p>Our textbook use the following notation for refering a specific normal distribution;</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma)
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> represents the mean and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> represents the standard deviation.</p>
<p>Let us look at the impact of the mean and standard deviation on the shape of Normal distribtuions.</p>

<h2>The 68-95-99.7 rule</h2>
<p>The rule is as follows;</p>
<pre><code>- Approx. 68% of the obs. fall within one std. range of the mean.
- Approx. 95% of the obs. fall within two std. range of the mean.
- Approx. 99.7% of the obs. fall within three std. range of the mean.</code></pre>

<p>Professor upload the distribution of Homework score in ICON as above and the class consists of 100 students.</p>
<ul>
<li>Q1. You checked your score out and found that your score was 12. How many people got the homework score which is below yours approximately?</li>
</ul>
<details>
<p><summary>
Answer
</summary></p>
<p>12 is the score which is one standard deviation above from the mean.</p>
<p>84% = 50% + 34%</p>
about 84 students.
</details>
<ul>
<li>Q2. How many people got the homework scores which are between 10 and 14?</li>
</ul>
<details>
<p><summary>
Answer
</summary></p>
<p>47.5% = 95% / 2</p>
Thus, about 48 students obtained the score between 10 and 14.
</details>
<ul>
<li>Q3. How many people got the homework scores which are between 8 and 14?</li>
</ul>
<details>
<p><summary>
Answer
</summary></p>
<p>81.5% = 47.5% + 34%</p>
About 82 students.
</details>
<ul>
<li><p>Q4. Do you think the following statement is right?</p>
<pre><code>  IQR of the homework score is larger than 4.</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<details>
<p><summary>
Answer
</summary></p>
<p>No.Â IQR is shorter than 1 standard deviation range from the mean. Since IQR captures the middle 50%, 1 std range will capture about middle 68%.</p>
