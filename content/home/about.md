I am generally interested in many machine learning techniques which can be applied in actuarial science field. More specifically, here are some lists of topics which graped my attention thesedays:

- Replacing nested monte calro simulation in insurance product valuation process.
- Making compression portfoilo of insurance products
- Pricing auto insurance using GLM
