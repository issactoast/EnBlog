      <description>As an employee, I am trying to construct my portfolio these days. By sharing my research materials, I hope that my article makes you either become interested in me or the driving telematics topic itself! =]
I wrote all the code in this article to use them as a tool for my Ph.D.Â research. Thus, they are not efficient code and have much room for improvement, and also, it might have some typo or error.</description>
