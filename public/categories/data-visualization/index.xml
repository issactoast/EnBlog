      <description>As an employee, I am trying to construct my own portfolio thesedays. By sharing my research materials, I hope that my article makes you either become interested in me or in the driving telematics topic.
All the code used in here written by me. I wrote them for doing my Ph.D.Â research. Thus, they are not efficient code and has a lot of room for improvements and also it might has some typo or error.</description>
