      <description>This article is also one of my portfolio articles, but I should note that this article is written based on a wornderful course that I took at the University of Iowa: the intensive computing course.
The following are the R packages used in this post.
library(datasets)library(magrittr)library(microbenchmark)library(gmp)Normal equation for the beta vectorToday, I want to talk little bit about the process of getting the coefficients of a linear model in R.</description>

      <description>As an employee, I am trying to construct my portfolio these days. By sharing my research materials, I hope that my article makes you either become interested in me or the driving telematics topic itself! =]
I wrote all the code in this article to use them as a tool for my Ph.D. research. Thus, they are not efficient code and have much room for improvement, and also, it might have some typo or error.</description>

      <description>Let us assume that we have following data set;
50, 80, 60, 90, 70MeanThe mean is the sum of all values in a data set divided by the number of values in the data set.
\[mean = \frac{50 + 80 + 60 + 90 + 70}{5} = 70\]
Q. What is the mean of these numbers?
10, 11, 21, 13, 20, 16  Answer</description>

      <description>SAT. and ACT. Scores (Standardization)Let us assume you are working at the U of Iowa addmistration department. Every spring semester, you have many application from many future hawk eyes. Today, you have to pick one person to give an admission and you have these infomation about test score of three students;
Issac : SAT score - 1250 JAMES : SAT score - 1300 ROBERT: ACT score - 30
Which student should get the admission if the administration process are evaluated by only their test scores?</description>

      <description>Let us assume that we have following data set;
50, 80, 60, 90, 70Now, we want to talk about the spread of our data. There are som
RangeThe range is one of the measures that captures the spread of the data, which can be calculated by subtracing the minimum of the data set from the maximum of the data set.
\[\begin{aligned}Range &amp;amp; = max(data) - min(data) \\&amp;amp; = 90 - 50 = 40\end{aligned}\]</description>

      <description>Normal distributionFrom the basic statistics course, we are already familiar with a bell-shape distribution called Normal distribution.
Here are some characteristics of all Normal curves;
- Symmetric, Unimodal- It can be specified by its mean and standard deviation.- Mean is related to center of the distribution.- Sd controls the spread of the distribution.- All Normal distribution obey the 68-95-99.7 rule.Our textbook use the following notation for refering a specific normal distribution;</description>

      <description>Make your own functionWe know R can do some calculation. I am always confused when I use Fahrenheit, “ºF”, instead of using Celsius “ºC”. I searched the conversion formula on the internet.
(°F − 32) × 5/9 = °CBased on the formula, 89 Fahrenheit is equal to 31.7 Celsius as follows;
(89 - 32) * 5/9## [1] 31.66667Can you convert the following Fahrenheits in Celcius?
67, 45, 92, 83, 70We can run the following five codes;</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Normality for the Sample CTE Revisited</title>

      <description>AbstractInsurance regulation relies on the conditional tail expectation(CTE) of a loss random variable for specifying required capital as well as for valuation of liabilities. Hence, understanding statistical inference of the CTE measure is an important aspect of actuarial education.
A key property of the non-parametric estimator of the CTE is its asymptotic normality, see Manistre and Hancock (2005)1, Ahn and Shyamalkumar (2011)2.
Traditional proofs of this result relies on various forms of functional delta method3, which makes the proof outside the scope of even masters level actuarial education.</description>
