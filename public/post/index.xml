      <description>Normal distributionFrom the basic statistics course, we are already familiar with a bell-shape distribution called Normal distribution.
Here are some characteristics of all Normal curves;
- Symmetric, Unimodal- It can be specified by its mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$- Mean is related to center of the distribution.- Sd controls the spread of the distribution.- All Normal distribution obey the 68-95-99.7 rule.Our textbook use the following notation for refering a specific normal distribution;</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;More than&amp;rdquo; vs. &amp;ldquo;Of&amp;rdquo; Definitions:
 Using &amp;ldquo;of&amp;rdquo;
In a class, there are 30 students. By the policy of the university, 10% of the class will get &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; grades. How many people would get &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; at the end of the semester?
 Using &amp;ldquo;more than&amp;rdquo;
Issac runs an ice cream store and today he got 100 customers. He wants to forecast the number of tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s customers using statistical method. After the study, he predicts that the number of the customers will be 50% more than today&amp;rsquo;s customer.</description>

      <description>Make your own functionWe know R can do some calculation. I am always confused when I use Fahrenheit, “ºF”, instead of using Celsius “ºC”. I searched the conversion formula on the internet.
(°F − 32) × 5/9 = °CBased on the formula, 89 Fahrenheit is equal to 31.7 Celsius as follows;
(89 - 32) * 5/9## [1] 31.66667Can you convert the following Fahrenheits in Celcius?
67, 45, 92, 83, 70We can run the following five codes;</description>

      <description>Problem 1 (Data types) Definitions:
 Qualitative data: values that can be placed into nonnumerical categories.
 Nominal level of measurement - No ranking!
 Ordianl level of measurement - It has ranking system!
  Quantitative data: values representing counts or measurments
 Countinuous data takes any value in a given interval.
 Discrete data can take on only particular, distinct values and not other values in between.</description>
